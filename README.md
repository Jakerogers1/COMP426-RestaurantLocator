# COMP426-FinalProject

# Choosey Web Application

This repository contains an interactive platform for searching and reviewing businesses using the Yelp API.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts: the front-end and the back-end.

### Front-End

The front-end is built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

- `index.html`: The homepage with a search bar and navigation.
- `search_results.html`: Displays search results.
- `business_detail.html`: Shows detailed information about a selected business.
- `styles.css`: Contains the styles for the web application.

### Back-End

The back-end is a simple Express server that serves the front-end files and handles the Yelp API integration.

- `app.js`: The main server file.
- `public/`: Directory to serve static files from.
